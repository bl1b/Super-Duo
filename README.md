# Alexandria
Alexandria is a book management application. ISBN-Numbers can be entered or scanned with your
device's camera and stored in a list. It gets the book information from a Google API. All titles,
cover images, and author information come from there. It's published as part of my Udacity Android
Nanodegree program's curriculum.

## ABOUT
The original version of this app was built by Sascha Jaschke, and a modified version is given to
students in the Udacity Android Nanodegree program. The code is modified by me to improve stability
and functionality (e.g. camera usage to scan ISBN Barcodes).
